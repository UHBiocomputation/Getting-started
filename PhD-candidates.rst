Probably needs to be ordered better, but there are quite a few things than can
be done in parallel:

- Get your ID card: during registration?
- Get access to the laboratory added to your ID card: ask supervisors to e-mail
  administrators.
- Get your *two* university user accounts: at registration, else speak to the
  doctoral college.
- If you are a Tier 4 student, get your Blue card: from our administrators (in
  B102 or B104).
