Check list for PhD candidates
------------------------------

The very first steps (it will be very helpful for you to complete those within first days on the Uni):

- Create an Induction Checklist on the `rsms.herts.ac.uk -> Registration/Progression -> Student Induction <https://rsms.herts.ac.uk/herts/#he.herts/studentInduction,;>`__. You have a month, starting from you enrollment, to complete it.
- Do the on-line induction on the `study.net <http://www.studynet2.herts.ac.uk/res/research.nsf/Teaching+Documents?OpenView&count=9999&restricttocategory=Students/Induction>`__ - a lot of useful information is presented there.
- Arrange a meeting with Dr. Na Helian- write an email to her (n.helian@herts.ac.uk) saying that you are a new PhD student in the Biocomputation group. She will be happy to meet with you and might clarify some of the points on the Induction checklist that are not clear for you.

Probably needs to be ordered better, but there are quite a few things than can
be done in parallel:

- Get your ID card: during registration?
- Get access to the laboratory added to your ID card: ask supervisors to e-mail
  administrators.
- Get your *two* university user accounts: at registration, else speak to the
  doctoral college.
- If you are a Tier 4 student, get your Blue card: from our administrators (in
  B102 or B104).
- Get key to the lab: ask supervisors to e-mail administrators.
- Get a new system: ask supervisors to file a ticket.
- Get a desk: speak to lab desk manager.
- Subscribe to the `mailing list
  <http://lists.herts.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/com-bio>`__: do it yourself.
- Get added to the `Github organisation
  <https://github.com/UHBiocomputation>`__: ask the Github organisation admins.
- Join the group's Slack setup: ask a Slack admin.
- Get a `16--25 rail card <https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/>`__: do it
  yourself.
- Learn how `university room numbers are distributed
  <https://wayfinding.herts.ac.uk/>`__: do it yourself.
- Add your name to the `website
  <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/pages/03-people.html>`__: open a `PR
  <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/pages/08-SOP-nonadmins.html>`__.
- Add your name to the `seminar rota
  <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/pages/05-seminars.html>`__: open a PR or ask an admin.
- Add your name to the list on the lab door: ask the lab desk manager.
- Open your bank account (Barclays in Town centre, Santander in Hutton Hub):
  collect student letter from student centre?
- `Register with NHS
  <https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/how-can-we-help/how-do-i-choose-and-register-with-a-gp/>`__:
  at university if living in Hatfield, at local GP if out.


Things that need adding:
