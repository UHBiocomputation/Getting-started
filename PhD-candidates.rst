Check list for PhD candidates
------------------------------

The very first steps (it will be very helpful for you to complete those within first days at the Uni):

- Create an Induction Checklist on the `rsms.herts.ac.uk -> Registration/Progression -> Student Induction <https://rsms.herts.ac.uk/herts/#he.herts/studentInduction,;>`__. You have a month, starting from you enrollment, to complete it.
- Do the on-line induction on the `study.net <http://www.studynet2.herts.ac.uk/res/research.nsf/Teaching+Documents?OpenView&count=9999&restricttocategory=Students/Induction>`__ - a lot of useful information is presented there.
- **Outdated?** Arrange a meeting with Dr. Na Helian- write an email to her (n.helian@herts.ac.uk) saying that you are a new PhD student in the Biocomputation group. She will be happy to meet with you and might clarify some of the points on the Induction checklist that are not clear for you.

Probably needs to be ordered better, but there are quite a few things than can
be done in parallel :

- Get your ID card: Go to Hutton Hubduring registration?
- Get access to the laboratory added to your ID card: ask supervisors to e-mail the head of department. For Computer Science this is Simon Trainis. Students should not email Simon or Estates/Access Control directly.
- Get your  university user account: at registration, else speak to the
  doctoral college (this will be your student account, there is an option to get another account once you become Visiting Lecturer and start teaching).
- If you have a student visa, get your Blue card to log your attendance: from our administrators (in
  B102 or B104).
- If you are an overseas student with a student visa, collect your BRP. You should get an email when it's ready to collect at Hutton Hub.
- **Outdated** Get key to the lab: ask supervisors to e-mail administrators.
- Get a new system: ask supervisors to file a ticket.
- Get a desk: speak to lab desk manager.
- Subscribe to the mailing lists:

  - `Com-Bio <https://list.herts.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/com-bio>`__: do it yourself.
  - `Com-Adjunct <https://list.herts.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/com-adjunct>`__: do it yourself.

- Get added to the `Github organisation
  <https://github.com/UHBiocomputation>`__: ask the Github organisation admins.
- Join the group's Slack setup: ask a Slack admin.
- Get a `16--25 rail card <https://www.16-25railcard.co.uk/>`__: do it
  yourself.
- Learn how `university room numbers are distributed
  <https://wayfinding.herts.ac.uk/>`__: do it yourself.
- Add your name to the `website
  <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/pages/03-people.html>`__: ask an admin 
  (ask one of the PhD students who is currently an admin for the website or rota) or open a `PR
  <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/pages/08-SOP-nonadmins.html>`__.
- Add your name to the `seminar rota
  <http://biocomputation.herts.ac.uk/pages/05-seminars.html>`__:  ask an admin or open a PR.
- Add your name to the list on the lab door: ask the lab desk manager.
- Open your bank account (**Outdated?** Barclays in Town centre, Santander in Hutton Hub):
  collect student letter from student centre?
- `Register with NHS
  <https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/how-can-we-help/how-do-i-choose-and-register-with-a-gp/>`__:
  at university if living in Hatfield, at local GP if out.
  
Other information:
Keep in mind that Microsoft SharePoint is very useful. When you're not sure how to do something, log into your Microsoft student account and search for it SharePoint. It is full of giudes and might answer your questions.

Things that need adding:

- induction bits.
- RDP bits.
